# cpanel_backup
Script to automate multiple cPanel backups to FTP using UAPI tokens.

This means the script will work regardless of what Theme is in use or if the account password is updated.

This script has been pulled from a few different existing cPanel scripts and updated to use the UAPI URL over a hardcoded theme URL.
